Personal Blog where I could be linking info about my current projects, personal or academic; but also about my Violoncello and Multimedia projects.
I am a faculty member at the UTHermosillo, in my town Hermosillo, Sonora, MÃ©xico.
Also I am continiously working in IT projects with local communities and companys.
And... I'm also a professional cellist at my dear OFS, (Sonora Philarmonic Orchestra), on covid-halt right now, but waiting to resurge! :)
